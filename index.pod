=head1 Simple DirectMedia Library Bindings for Perl

Welcome to the new SDL Perl pages, graciously hosted by Perl.org.

=head2 Latest News

B<11 August 2009> SDL_Perl is on Github

The master branch is stable on CPAN as v2.2.0. This only Builds on Linux and Darwin platforms.
Work is being done on v2.2.1 to add building support for other platforms.

The bleeding edge code is available from
L<http://github.com/kthakore/SDL_Perl/>.

See
L<http://search.cpan.org/~dgoehrig/SDL_Perl-2.2.0/lib/SDL.pm>.  Please report any strange behavior
to the list. 



=head2 Tutorials Online!

We've written four tutorials so far, and you can read them online:

=over 4

Of course, if you grab a snapshot and install it, not only can you report
successes (and probably a few bugs), but you can play with the demo program for
each tutorial!  It's very fun.

Developing games with Perl and SDL on Ars Technica written by Andy Bakun
L<http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2006/02/games-perl.ars>

=head2 A Little History

Why are these pages new?  In October, David GE<ouml>hrig, the creator and
maintainer of SDL Perl, announced that he was quitting his job, selling all his
stuff, and going backpacking in Europe for a few months.  That left SDL Perl
without a maintainer or a home. But SDL Perl is back and running with Kartik and 
David's help.

=head2 Future Plans

We're working on polishing the latest code available to make the v2.2.1
release. One of our goals after a working build is to have a Parrot parser 
with Perl 5 NCI to make installing even simpler.

Here is the roadmap so far. 
L<http://wiki.github.com/cthulhuology/SDLPerl>

Hopefully, Perl will soon be a wonderful language in which to write media
applications -- including games.

We'll be making archives of the old mailing list available.  Subscribe to the

=head2 Applications


App-Fotagger is an application to add tags to images.
It was the first attempt of Thomas Klausner at SDL and 
it can be improved a lot: L<http://search.cpan.org/dist/App-Fotagger>

=head2 Games

The original Frozen Bubble L<http://www.frozen-bubble.org/> is probably 
the most well known application written in SDL Perl.

Thomas Klausner has started a Space Invaders clone in SDL Perl. 
You can find the code on Github L<http://github.com/domm/Game-PerlInvaders>.
